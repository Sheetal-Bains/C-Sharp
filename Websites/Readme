Website templates are pre-designed web page layouts that serve as a foundation for building a website. 
These templates provide a structure and visual framework, often including elements such as headers, footers, navigation menus, and placeholder content, allowing users to customize and populate the site with their own text, images, and branding elements. They are a time-saving solution for individuals and businesses looking to establish an online presence without the need for extensive web development skills. Website templates come in various styles and themes, catering to diverse industries and purposes, from e-commerce and portfolios to blogs and corporate sites. These templates are typically coded and designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless and consistent user experience across various devices. 
Whether one is launching a personal blog or a professional business site, website templates provide a convenient and cost-effective way to create a visually appealing and functional online presence.
